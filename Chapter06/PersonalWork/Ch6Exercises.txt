6.1	The following two functions have errors. What are they?
		
		static bool Write()
		{
			Console.WriteLine("Text output from function.");
		}
		static void MyFunction(string label, params int[] args, bool showLabel)
		{
			if (showLabel)
				Console.WriteLine(label);
			foreach (int i in args)
				Console.WriteLine($"{i}");
		}
		
			Answer:	Static bool Write() is expecting a bool return but doesn't return anything, as written it should be Static void Write().
					The params int[] should be the last argument for the function statci void MyFunction().
					
		
6.2	Write an application that uses two command-line arguments to place values into a string and an integer variable, respectively. Then display those values.

	Answer: See program solution in accompanying folder.

	Answer:	See program solution in accompanying folder.
			

6.4	Modify the following struct to include a function that returns the total price of an order:

		struct Order
		{
			public string itemName;
			public int unitCount;
			public double unitCost;
		}
		
			answer: 
				struct Order
				{
					public string itemName;
					public int unitCount;
					public double unitCost;
					public double totalCost() => unitCount * unitCost;
				}

6.5	Add another function to the Order struct that returns a formatted string as follows (as a single line of text, where italic entries enclosed in angle brackets are replaced by appropriate values):

	Order Information: <unit count> <item name> items at $<unit cost> each, total cost $<total cost>
	
		answer:
			struct Order
				{
					public string itemName;
					public int unitCount;
					public double unitCost;
					public double totalCost() => unitCount * unitCost;
					public string aboutOrder() => "Order Information: " + unitCount.ToString() + " " + 
						itemName + " items at $" + unitCost.ToString + " each, total cost $" + totalCost.ToString();
				}
